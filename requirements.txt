# S3 Concurrent Operations - Runtime Dependencies
# 
# Analysis of s3_concurrent_uploader.py and s3_concurrent_downloader.py:
# 
# Both scripts use ONLY Python standard library modules:
# - argparse (command-line argument parsing)
# - subprocess (running AWS CLI commands) 
# - sys (system-specific parameters and functions)
# - threading (thread-based parallelism)
# - time (time-related functions)
# - concurrent.futures (high-level interface for asynchronously executing callables)
# - pathlib (object-oriented filesystem paths)
# - glob (Unix shell-style pathname pattern expansion) - uploader only
# - os (operating system interface) - uploader only  
# - fnmatch (Unix filename pattern matching) - downloader only, imported conditionally
#
# EXTERNAL SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
# - AWS CLI must be installed and configured on the system
# - Python 3.6+ (uses concurrent.futures and pathlib)
#
# NO PYTHON PACKAGES NEED TO BE INSTALLED FOR RUNTIME
# All imports are from Python standard library

# Uncomment below only if you need to ensure setuptools for building/packaging:
# setuptools>=45
